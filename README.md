# Fork info

This is a fork of [https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill](usbkill) by hephaest0s. 

I've kept most of the features so please do check the original README, but here is a list of changes. 

  * Stripped almost 100 lines of code
  * Depends on argparse instead of doing its own parsing of sys.argv
  * No Python3 support with ConfigParse
  * Depends on logger instead of implementing its own solution
  * No shredding of logs or data supported
  * Added ability to reload configuration file when SIGUSR1 is received
  * Limited the configuration files to ./usbkill.conf and /etc/usbkill.conf
  * Added option to skip duplicate USB IDs checking
